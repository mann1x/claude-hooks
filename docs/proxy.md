# claude-hooks proxy (Phases P0 + P1) — setup

Opt-in local HTTP proxy in front of `api.anthropic.com`. Hooks can't
see the raw HTTPS traffic; the proxy can. P0 is **observability
only** — pure pass-through, one JSONL record per upstream request.

Design + phased roadmap: [PLAN-proxy-hook.md](./PLAN-proxy-hook.md).

## What you get in P0

- Every upstream request logged with: timestamp, method, path, status,
  duration, bytes in/out, model requested, model delivered, token
  `usage` block, rate-limit headers, `is_warmup` flag, synthetic-rate-
  limit flag.
- **Warmup detection** — `is_warmup: true` whenever the first user
  message is the literal string `"Warmup"`. Gives you a live counter
  instead of mining transcripts after the fact.
- **Synthetic rate-limit detection** — `synthetic: true` whenever the
  response carries `"model": "<synthetic>"`, i.e. Claude Code's
  client-side false rate limiter (bug B3 per ArkNill's #42796
  analysis).
- **Real rate-limit headers** captured verbatim under `rate_limit`
  (all `anthropic-ratelimit-*` / `x-ratelimit-*` / `retry-after`) —
  P1 will feed these into `scripts/weekly_token_usage.py` to
  auto-populate `--current-usage-pct`.

## Enable

1. Edit `config/claude-hooks.json` (copy the `proxy` block from
   `config/claude-hooks.example.json` if missing):

   ```json
   "proxy": {
     "enabled": true,
     "listen_host": "127.0.0.1",
     "listen_port": 38080,
     "upstream": "https://api.anthropic.com",
     "timeout": 120.0,
     "log_requests": true,
     "log_dir": "~/.claude/claude-hooks-proxy",
     "log_retention_days": 14,
     "record_rate_limit_headers": true,
     "block_warmup": false
   }
   ```

2. Start the proxy (foreground — `Ctrl-C` to stop):

   ```bash
   # POSIX shim (prefers conda env's python)
   bin/claude-hooks-proxy

   # Or directly
   python3 -m claude_hooks.proxy
   ```

   On Windows: `bin\claude-hooks-proxy.cmd`.

3. Point Claude Code at it via `~/.claude/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:38080"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Open a new Claude Code session. Every request is now logged under
   `~/.claude/claude-hooks-proxy/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.

## Operational notes

- **Default OFF.** Nothing spawns until `enabled: true` + the binary is
  running.
- **Local-only by default.** `listen_host: "127.0.0.1"` keeps it off
  the LAN. Don't change this unless you have a reason.
- **Streaming-safe.** SSE (extended thinking) responses stream
  chunk-by-chunk; the proxy only peeks the opening 4 KB for metadata,
  never buffers the whole body.
- **Auth headers pass through verbatim.** `x-api-key`, `authorization`,
  `anthropic-*` are never inspected or mutated.
- **Log rotation.** One file per UTC day; files older than
  `log_retention_days` are pruned hourly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port in use.** Change `listen_port`. 38080 is the default and
  was free on solidPC + pandorum at time of writing.
- **TLS errors contacting `api.anthropic.com`.** Python's stdlib uses
  the system trust store; on Debian/Ubuntu make sure `ca-certificates`
  is installed.
- **Claude Code can't reach the proxy.** `curl http://127.0.0.1:38080/`
  should return a 502 with a JSON error body. If that works but CC
  doesn't, double-check the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var is applied
  (open a fresh session after editing settings.json).
- **Turn it off.** Unset `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in settings.json and
  stop the proxy process. Claude Code goes back to hitting the API
  directly on the next session.

## What's new in P1

- **SSE tail** captures the final `usage` block from the trailing
  `message_delta` event (the canonical billing numbers) instead of
  the estimate from `message_start`. Falls back to `message_start`
  when no `message_delta` arrives.
- **`stop_reason`** captured from `message_delta.delta.stop_reason`
  (`end_turn` / `tool_use` / `max_tokens` / …).
- **Rolling rate-limit state file** at
  `<log_dir>/ratelimit-state.json`. Atomic-replace write on every
  response that carries `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers.
- **`scripts/weekly_token_usage.py` auto-populates `--current-usage-pct`**
  from that state file. If the proxy is running and Claude Code has
  hit the API at least once this window, the `%Limit` column appears
  without any manual input. Footer notes when the value came from the
  proxy (with source timestamp) so you know it's live, not stale.
- **`--proxy-state PATH`** new CLI flag to point the script at a
  non-default state file (testing / multi-host setups).

## What's new in P3 (block_warmup)

- **`block_warmup: true`** short-circuits Warmup requests at the
  proxy. Upstream is never called. Returns a minimal
  Anthropic-compatible reply:
  - Non-streaming → JSON `{"type": "message", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "usage": {zeros}}`
  - Streaming → valid SSE (`message_start` → `content_block_*` →
    `message_delta` → `message_stop`)
- **Log line gains `warmup_blocked: true`** so you can count savings.
- **Header marker** `X-Claude-Hooks-Proxy: warmup-blocked` on every
  blocked reply for quick `curl` verification.

Enable in `config/claude-hooks.json`:

```json
"proxy": {
  "enabled": true,
  "block_warmup": true
}
```

Then you can drop `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` from
`~/.claude/settings.json` and get Ctrl+B + Bash `run_in_background`
back, because the proxy is killing Warmup on its own.
